This is my GitHub user page made with [Jekyll-Bootstrap 0.3.0](http://jekyllbootstrap.com), and [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).

### Some useful tools I use:

-[alias generator for Jekyll](https://github.com/tsmango/jekyll_alias_generator) make alias link
-[instafeed.js](https://github.com/stevenschobert/instafeed.js) to add a photos page and sidebar with recent Instagram photos


Have any feedback for me? [File an issue on this
project](https://github.com/kinghom/Feedback/issues/new) and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
